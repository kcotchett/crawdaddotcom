<p>hedges on fleek (March 5th, 2023)</p>

<p>back at it for some car-less gravel rides. tommy suggested the snoqualmie valley trail. i hadnt been out this far on the i90 trail, so why the fuck not.unfortunatley, tommy had to bail for some needed chores, but we picked up graham! graham is fairly new to the pnw, so he got a bit of an eastside day tour in. </p>

          <p>graham met me up at my place and we peddled over the i90. we met up at 8:45 am on a brisk day, but graham was ready for summer those shorts! you'll notice this time around the guys at <a href="https://goodweatherinseattle.com/">goodweather</a> helped install some fenders for me. cant be lookin like i shit myself again.</p>

        <p>jt met us up, got a second to meet graham and dork out on their respective all city's. one person on the ride must ride fenderless. a lil communal swig of whiskey to initiate the long day ahead, and we we were off!</p>

      <p>the i90 trail, especially the bridge, is probably my least favorite to ride at this point, but it has its moments</p>

          <p>the sun came out stronger than any of us expected. maybe graham made the right friggin call on those shorts...</p>

          <p>the great debate - pick up beer before the hill and carry the load or risk not finding a beer dispensary at the top of the hill? we chose the former.</p>

      <p>we were cruising down those hill bombs and rattling our bikes. Kelly luckily heard her fender getting loose and stopped before she lost her bolts! a lil roadside maintenance. she handled it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="main-block">
    <img src="IMG_4858 2.jpeg" />
    <p>the maintenance gave us a minute to indulge on some snacks. i'm starting a french bicycle club. the premise is i bring fancy cheese, a baguette, and cured meats. cheese can only be cut by an opinel knife in this club. contact me if you'd like to join.</p>

<div class="main-block">

  <p>right before we found out snack spot, we came across some trail closed signs before a gnarly set of switchbacks. we decided to ignore the sign and climb up. While stuffing our face with cheese, bread, salami, and beer, we saw this lady beast it out up the switch backs. she handled that shit no problem. hopefully our cheering on bossted her up too.</p>

<div class="main-block">

  <p>upon cresting the slope she came over and let us know its her 62nd birthday this week. she's killin it!</p>

      <p>found out why the bridge is closed (losing structural integrity). maybe dont follow in our dumbass foot steps for your own safety.</p>

      <p>found ourselves in some good thicc single track. the dirt was tasty, the air fresh, the old ladies friendly, and the final hills brutal.</p>
 </div>

<div class="main-block">
  <img src="IMG_5142.jpeg" />
  <p>we emerged from the forest winded into a fresh subdivision (snoqualmie ridge). we werent really expecting that. i was hoping to take down my second peer upon cresting the hill, but the man diligently trimming his hedges (ride named for him) and the parents with their kids enjoying their sunday afternoon led me to believe this isnt my friendly neighborhood capitol hill park bar.</p>

<p>getting through the neighborhood, jt and i soon realized we came here about 3 years ago on a whim to skate this park when it was brand new.</p>

<div class="main-block">

<p>got one hell of a hill bomb in with the cascades as the backdrop. a welcomed break after that climb.</p>

<p>probably the most brutal part of the ride. this is what happens when you hastily make google maps routes to ride at work. i found a connection through 133rd street to the tolt trail, without looking at the topography. as we rode along snoqualmie valley road, i couldnt keep my eyes off the geographic wall we were inevitably going to have to climb. sorry guys haha. icing on the cake was that there were private road signs on it all. oh well, no one said shit to us. i think jt had it the worst. we climbed this whole damn hill in bike cleats. yeeeeash.</p>

<div class="main-block">

  <p>tried to see if we could avoid 124th this time around. failed again...</p>

  <div class="main-block">
    <img src="IMG_5243.jpg" />
    <p>it was a bright and sunny all day, then we hit the CKC, the sun fell, and the rain came. oh well. we got a couple snickers bars at the 7-11 to power through this last bit.</p>
    </div>

  <p>the new lights are on the trail though!</p>

  <p>made it to the 255 and decided to forgo the ride across 520. i think at this point we all were stoked on this decision.</p>

  <p>the ol' seattle ski lift to cap hill.</p>

  <video src="IMG_5253.mov" controls></video> 
  <p>manage to scrape some final gravel in the rain as i rode home through cal anderson.</p>

<p>this was a much longer ride than i have done in a while. felt really good to do! its always fun getting out of the everdeveloping seattle area and into the foothills to remind yourself some rural parts void of the sound of cars is only a stones throw away from me. as i said, i'll be doin this one in summer again and jumping in those friggin rivers. </p>
