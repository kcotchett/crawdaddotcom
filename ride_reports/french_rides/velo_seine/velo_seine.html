<p>paris to deauville (la seine a velo - august 2023)</p>

<p>kaylie and i both have been wanting to go on a bicycle tour, but working 40 hours a week with 12 days of vacation a year doesn't leave much time. your vacation ideas and family time are pitted against each other in a bloody battle resulting in a pyrrhic victory to whatever emerges as the winner for that year. taking 3 months off work, we knew we'd finally get to this one under our belt and now looking to do more in the future. we had a couple of ideas for where to do this tour, some more lofty than others. one of these was taking a flight from paris to scotland to do the <a href=https://www.visitscotland.com/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/cycling/hebridean-way-cycling-route>hebridean way cycling route</a>. it looks like a real good time, hopefully one day, but not this summer. we opted for the <a href=https://www.laseineavelo.fr>la seine a velo</a>. 279 miles from paris to deauville following the meandering path of the seine.</p>

<p>we gave ourselves 5 days to get from paris to the coast of normandy, which was a goal of about 55 miles per day. this proved to be more than manageable and gave us plenty of time to have breakfast, snap some photos, eat some snacks, and get into our destination to find some dinner and a beer (or two). we only booked our deauville hotel and train, and opted to book our hotels afternoon of the stay. this let us gauge if we wanted to push ourselves to go further or mellow out.</p>

<p>the route was pretty insanely well marked. having worked in local government, this had to be no easy feat to get this all coordinated. i gotta meet the person who set this up and take some notes... anyways, down below i got the map, photos from our tour and some notes. enjoy ✌(ツ)</p>

<p>i didn't make this map. i found it online and saved it to my maps so i could pull it up on my google maps app as we rode.</p>

  <p>packing list</p>
  <p>this was just credit card touring, and being such i wanted to see how minimally i could pack. a little experiment to see if i wish i packed more, or possibly even less. i brought a carradice nelson longflap bag, which was supported by a nitto 33r large rear rack. if you read my <a href=http://www.crawdadcollective.com/ride_reports/french_rides/fontainbleau/fontainbleau.html>fontainebleau</a> ride report, you'll see i attempted to go rackless, and that was my experimental trip. i have a bagman rack at home i have used a few times, but opted at the last minute not to bring it to france. luckily, the good folks at <a href=https://www.lachouetteparis.com>la chouette</a> had the nitto rack in stock i could get it installed day off a few weeks back to solve the issue. i read through the old <a href=https://www.trentobike.org/Countries/Europe/General/Europe_Touring_Guide.html>jobst brandt "guide to bicycle touring in europe"</a> to get some ideas as to what to bring. in the rear bag i packed two linen shirts, a pair of shorts, a pair of linen pants, a lightweight fleece sweater, a rain jacket, a book, sketchbook, a bag of pens, a toiletry bag, and a bag of tools (patch kit, 2 spare tubes, chain lube, multi-tool, and an opinel knife). the first four articles of clothing were just for the 48 hours in deauville. in the front i had an acorn handle bar bag to hold the charging brick, cords, snacks, and - when it rained - my sony a6000. i opted to wear one cycling outfit for the 5 days that consisted of a wool jersey (found at la chouette for €30 while buying my rack), black target swim trunks (lookin for that quick dry element), a cycling cap, and a pair of keens. i have been reading up on merino wool jerseys and meant to be buy one before i left the states, but time got the better of me. stoked i found one out here. that jersey lived up to what i was reading. minimal odor, and i could rinse the jersey at night and expect it to be dry by morning if need be.</p>
