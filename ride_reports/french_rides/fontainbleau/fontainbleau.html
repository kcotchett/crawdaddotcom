<p>fontainebleau</p>

<p>our inagural french ride on our pair of atlantises (the atlanti as i refer to them). our our bags worked well (i stuffed some extra fom in there) to fly over our bags, racks, and bicycles. Even got a floor pump in there! We also have our lil doggos out here, so we decided to test an overnight with a pet sitter and decided to use our time for an overnighter to <a href=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontainebleau>fontainebleau</a>. i found the route below to follow. unfortunately we are in the midst of some rain storms out here. we tried to avoid the rain best we could, and ended up with a late start. Even so, we still found ourselves taking breaks under bridges and canopies to avoid those parisian 15 minute down pours. we ended up cutting directly south a melun, and nixing the return ride and opting for the train on the way home. more rain was in the forecast, and simply wanted to enjoy what time we had in this small town. i found a skateshop (actually kaylie) out there - things i didnt expect! enjoy the photos below!</p>
