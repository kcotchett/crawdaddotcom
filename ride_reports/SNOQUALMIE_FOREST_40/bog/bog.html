        <p>well in blissful ignorance we traveled past gate 9 and through some overgrown and lightly beaten paths.</p>

      <p>we set out to start riding but i was reminded of some pesky chain and derailleur rubbing. we found these horse hitch things to perform some impromptu maintenance. but also photos.</p>

      <p>if you are unsure if you've passed gate 9, here is a second warning youve gone too far. the butterfly garden sign.</p>

     <p>no riding, pure hiking with our bikes slung over our shoulder. we are convinced the trail must pick back up ahead. hike a bikes typically make their way into our rides so we were'nt scared off initially. but the thick scrub wouldnt end, but the watch said we were fine and the trail was just ahead.. we listened and followed our fearless watch. we lay the bikes down for a quick rest.</p>

      <p>we thought we'd never see it, but we emerged from the bog and back onto the logging roads after about an hour of bushwacking. we hopped on the road, looked at eachother and knew we had to ride back to see where we went wrong. thats how we found gate 9.</p>

  <p>graham later sent me a screen shot of our tracked ride showing how close we were to the trail the whole time. dont miss gate 9!</p>
