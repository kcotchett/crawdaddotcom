<p>thrilla by bus (Feb 20, 2023)</p>

<p>i was looking for some gravel routes for jaytee and i to go get dirty on this weekend that wouldn't require us to drive. neither one of us have ideal car setups to take bikes outta town. i found this route called <a href=https://ridewithgps.com/routes/6284270?lang=en>"thrilla route"</a> on ride with gps.The route had a ton of gravel and was just what i was looking for. i have a base familiarity with the buses that go out east to redmond and the roads i'd have to take to get back there. i found some neighborhood greenways on google maps to minimize time on those suburban roads. i talked kelly into joining us (didnt take much) and they both blindly joined my route luckily!</p>

      <p>found a gas station to get supplies. no whiskey, but a red blend will do. jaytee also got his hands on some new sparkly gloves after he lost his on our last ride.</p>

          <p>the redmond business park streets were quiet on a sunday morning, but we were still glad to get a lil dirt trail appetizer. Bridle Crest Trail.</p>

      <div class="main-block">
          <img src="IMG_4843 2.jpeg" />
          <p>we had to wind through some streets on the border between kirkland and redmond, made ou way down to a cul-de-sac, and connected with another neighborhood greenway that got us to the powerline trail. mostly paved up to this portion. wet outside, but no rain.</p>
      </div>

          <img src="IMG_4848 2.jpeg" />
          <p>the first of a couple hike a bikes on the powerline trail. i told you they followed me blindly on this ride. still all smiles.</p>

          <img src="IMG_4851 2.jpeg" />
          <p>for the most part we had the powerline trail all to ourselves. we saw a handful of people walking, some with dogs. There were some fun little hill bombs to skid and catch a lil air off the lumber retaining lips.</p>
      </div>

      <p>we were cruising down those hill bombs and rattling our bikes. Kelly luckily heard her fender getting loose and stopped before she lost her bolts! a lil roadside maintenance. she handled it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="main-block">
    <img src="IMG_4858 2.jpeg" />
    <p>the maintenance gave us a minute to indulge on some snacks. i'm starting a french bicycle club. the premise is i bring fancy cheese, a baguette, and cured meats. cheese can only be cut by an opinel knife in this club. contact me if you'd like to join.</p>

  <p>riding fenderless at this point in the ride was going fine. more on that later... if you look at the map, we had just crossed avondale rd ne.</p>

  <p>and so begins the ride through the trails in the redmond watershed preserve. this was for sure the best part of the ride. dense old growth forests, fresh air, winding paths, it had it all!</p>

  <p>like the other trails we hit that day, we mostly had them to ourselves. we saw a few folks out, even some horse riders!</p>
</div>

<div class="main-block">

<p></p>

<div class="main-block">
  <img src="IMG_4917 2.jpeg" />
  <p>we got some even more intense hill bombs on this trail, those were great! had only one grueling hill climb to contend with. This descent beyond the crest pictured here was pretty gnarly.</p>

<div class="main-block">

<p>after the tolt, we linked with the sammamish river trail. a scene of bordering land uses with encroaching commercial uses to the west and old farm land to the east.</p>
</div>

<div class="main-block">
  <img src="IMG_4933.jpeg" />
  <p>as soon as we got to 124th st, we realized we should have gone a bit further and gotten on the east rail trail instead. if we did, we could have stayed on bike path, but now had to contend with cars blaring by at 45 miles an hour next to us in a narrow and unprotected bike lane. oh well, we learned what to do next time!</p>

<p>got onto the east rail trail, but had to detour for the construction of the new cross kirkland corridor bridge.</p>

<p>we finished up the ride on the cross kirkland corridor. the section going through the google campus was new to me! looking pretty wild.</p>

<p>a good solid day of riding! always nice to stay on trails, and not need a car to get there. i left my house at about 9 am and got back around 3:45 pm. jaytee and i loaded up on some wings and beer to recharge.</p>
