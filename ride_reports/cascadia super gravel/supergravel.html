<p>cascadia super gravel (April 2023)</p>

<p>a few months back jaytee suggested sign up for this 50 mile gravel ride. as usual, i didn't think about it and just signed up - sounded like a good way to break in being 30. if you're a masochist, this is the event for you!</p>

  there was a 30, 50, and 100 mi event - we opted for the 50.

        <p>within the first 5 miles we had 1200 ft to climb. we were awarded with some clear views of rainier and our first aid station with some melty m&ms. the course was super well marked with bright pink arrows, i didnt feel the need to turn on any maps which was sweet. sounds like this was a learning curve from last year. jaytee knew some other folks doin the ride and we joined their group!</p>

      <p>we were all so stoked for a descent, but god damn was this one was treacherous. loose and bumpy.</p>

  <p>we came out of the gravel and hit some road shortly after this. i thought i was at the home stretch but those fkcrs couldn't let us go yet. two brtual hil climbs were thrown our way within the last couple miles.</p>

<p>still had my fenders on so you know i had to smash through all the puddles. you know these sadistic bastards set these ponds up. would've loved to see all the hundred milers crashin through these at the start.</p>

  <p>sheeeesh we made it. the organizers supplied us with beer and pizza that was delivered every hour to keep it hot. a lot of folks seemed to finish, eat, and bolt. unfortunately wee did the same. i was hoping there would be more of a party vibe after.. i'll definitely be back next year. might have to camp both nights and bring some supplies next time to change that.</p>
