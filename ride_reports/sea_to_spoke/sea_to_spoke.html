<p>9:30 am - a group of eight of us met at the i-90 tunnel to begin riding east across the state. about half of our group was going to go to ellensberg and back, while the other half was going for the whole dang thing. i rerouted us a lil bit at the last second so i led the group and didn't take a lot of photos since i was a little preoccupied navigating. woops ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. i'll inundate you with photos for the remaining days.</p>

<p>about halfway through the day while hopping the fence of a closed bridge, taneum snapped his derailleur hanger by accidently releasing his rack. he rigged it up to go single speed the rest of the day. a friend happened to be working semi close to our big rest stop in north bend and brought him a back up hanger. alas the derailleur was shot too. he carried on going single speed into day 2.</p>

<p>we made it to alice creek campground, which had plenty of spots on a wednesday night. we were all a bit banged up after a short cut idea went awry. i'll be brief - never trust the googlemaps "short cut".</p>

  <p>aaaand there went taneum's rear cog and cassette body. when we got to the pass we happened to chat up a maintence crew manager for a bit, and to taneum's luck he was eating lunch just about where taneum's chain sucked right into the cog. he graciously took taneum into ellensburg in time to get a new wheel and rear derailleur before the local shop closed.the cassette body was ripped in half like a soda can by the single speed tension...</p>

<p>it was a long but mellow day with a good rest along the yakima river. we made it into ellensburg just before dark and got dinner as a group before about half our crew made a return to seattle. we also got to see taneum ride up to the restaurant with a funtional bike! what a friggin sight! we slept in real beds too. it'd be the last time til seattle. </p>

fueled up at the ol' continental brekky at the hotel, said our goodbye's to ol' willy, and got rollin' out! the original plan was to head out as early as we could to try to beat the heat, but decided it'd be good to get some more rest after a long previous day. turned out to not be as hot as we thought it would be luckily.

<p>after pushing through some hills and some tough terrain, it was all smiles to see the dang columbia river. we'd be greeted by some semi wild packs of dogs. one gang of chihuahuas and their rottweiler muscle. no one was bitten luckily.</p>

<p>we loaded up on supplies at the 76 in beverly and headed out to find a campsite for the night. the campsite at the beverly dunes seemed like a country teen drinking spot, so we opted to keep moving.</p>
