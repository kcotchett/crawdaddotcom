<p>i've managed to get a multi-day tour in the third week of august the last three years in a row. this year the tradition continued with jaytee on doin a lap around the olympic peninsula. i think i might have underestimated this route a bit. its a hilly and remote son o' bitch of a route. a one and doner fer sure, but god dang it we got it done ü§ù and glad we did. the coast is always a good time.</p>

  <p>i met up jaytee at the fast ferry downtown bound for kingston. an easy way to get this tour underway if you start on a weekday. i changed up this bike a bit since the seattle to spokane tour. i put on some randonneur bars, a new stem, shimano brake levers, and got a dynamo hub on the wheelset. i also opted for rear panniers this time around as opposed to the big ol saddle sack. happy with all the changes.</p>
  <p>jaytee and i were takin it a bit too easy on the first couple days. we'd later pay for that on the back end of the tour. we got off the ferry and went straight to the filling station for a beer and a shot. we were a bit eager to be on vacation.</p>

<p>little country markets are the oasis on these journey's. the quilcene village store was my favorite one on this tour. well stocked variety of food good for camping, good beer selection, a friggin mochi freezer, and a selection of whiskey. icing on the cake is that they are open til 11:00 pm. frickin' stores in capitol hill don't even stay open that late anymore!</p>
<p>we got about 60 mi in the first day and 5k of elevation. a decent start. we spent the night at the hiker/biker spots at sequim bay campground.</p>

  <p>we woke up in sequim bay and had a a lazy morning for no particular reason. slowly made some coffee, ate some breakfast, packed up, and checked out the beach for a bit. it was a beautiful morning didn't leave until about 10:00 am. as i said, we were in vacation mode the first two days. it was an easy paved 20 mi on the olympic discovery trail to port angeles.</p>
