<p>loggers loop (April 2023)</p>

<p>kaylie and i headed to the oregon coast for my birthday. i've spent a lot of time out there, but managed to not ride my bike around. the roof rack is helping change that! the week before i was finding several routes via ride with gps and even the seaside city webpage. we took on an abmbitious route, but wound up altering it  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>

    <p>the coast tends to just kick straight up from flat, so we were forced to start climbing from the start ¯\_༼ ಥ ‿ ಥ ༽_/¯. here is me finding a hack to get my speed back after i had to dismount and take a little water break.</p>
