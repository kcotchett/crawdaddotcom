  <p>olympic bridges overnighter august 2022</p>

<p>kelly, oli, kaylie and i went out to the shelton area and did a lil overnighter. kaylie found this one. good lil off road loop that we all managed to do on tires 35c and under. swam, ate some noodles, drank some booze by the fire, and slept in hammocks by a creek. good ol times.</p>

        <p>the easy campgrounds were full, but we found a nice lil spot by a creek. if you got the strength, up the hill theres a horse campground that seems rarely used.</p>

      <p>we were cruising down those hill bombs and rattling our bikes. Kelly luckily heard her fender getting loose and stopped before she lost her bolts! a lil roadside maintenance. she handled it.</p>

<p>pretty dang pleasant lil overnighter. trails were wide and the hills not too crazy; a nice lil intro to bicycle camping if you have the means to get there. we stopped in oly on the way back for a beer and some food.</p>
