  <div class="main-block">

      <p>i spent a lot of time in europe this summer. right after i got access to a dark room for the first time since 2012.</p>
  </div>
 
  <div class="main-block">

  </div>

  <div class="main-block">

      <p>it was a rough start in the dark room. practice and patience. the louvre.</p>
  </div>

<div class="main-block">
    <img src="5. gillies and notre dame004.jpg" />
    <p>this double exposure was especially difficult to get to come in semi clear. i need to try again. gilles at notre dame.</p>
</div>

<div class="main-block">
    <img src="6. me in paris001.jpg" />

<div class="main-block">

</div>

<div class="main-block">
    <img src="8. willy in discovery003.jpg" />
    <p>returned to seattle after that summer with will on my couch. tried to take a photo of the driftwood fort. he elbowed his way in. starting to get the feel back for prints.</p>
</div>
  
<div class="main-block">
  <img src="9. donut shop.png" />
  <p>the donut shop. my mom would take my sister and me here often. breakfast followed by smudging our little fingers on the donut case glass.</p>
</div>

<div class="main-block">
    <img src="10. will tailslide.png" />
    <p>shooting a skate photo on film is an art form i have not mastered. i should stick to candids and street photos. this tailslide was incredible though.</p>
</div>

<div class="main-block">
    <img src="11. elliot and some records copy.png" />
    <p>this was probably the print i am most proud of. the contrast and the proper lining up of the photo on the paper felt great. just as i got comfortable again in the dark room i got busy with graduate school and then lost access to the dark room after graduation. i'll have to find another one.</p>
