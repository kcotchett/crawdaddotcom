<p>i c e l a n d</p>

<p>i graduated grad school in 2018, held an internsip through the winter, and started a job january 2019. I'd been itchin for another int'l trip since my norway, germany, denmark, and france excursion in 2017. between switchin jobs, lack of vacation days/funds, covid, and just life in general int' travel was not on the horizon for sometime. Getting that booster shot back in spring '21 put it back on my radar. Kaylie had the itch too and my mere mentioning of iceland set her off on whippin my ass into gettin my ducks in a row to make this trip happen. Before i knew it Krista and alex were on board and basically the duffys planned the whole damn thing haha. it was dope. get yourself a duffy travel planner.</p>

          <p>We landed at around 6:45 am. naturally travelling with three sleep deprived wisconsites and myself, we got off the tarmac and scurried into the duty free store to load up on tax free booze. upon trying to check out we were told we went to the departues duty free store and had to go to the arrivals duty free store, which was after customs. naturally the line at least doubled by the time we went back out there. i didn't load up my camera for it, but we went straight to blue lagoon after we got our car. props to alex for hangin out in the hertz line for about an hour for us haha.</p>

      <p>came up on this geyser with everyone raising their phones to the sky intently staring at their screens waiting for the moment that geyser would give the damn people the squirt they've been waiting for. am i any better for staring through my viewfinder to capture these people looking like this? probably not, but alex and i had a good laugh at them as we circled back to this earth fountain on our way back to the car.</p>

  <p>we took a walk before it got dark and krista made friends with the farm kitty. we made pasta and got wasted playing more card games above the barn. i dont think i realized how drunk i was until we had to get up at 6 am to catch the ferry to the westman islands (vestmannaeyjar). cold breakfast pasta helped cure that problem.</p>

  <p>me and these goats sized each other up for like 5 min straight. we were at an impasse. i folded and sat my ass down to watch the boats enter the harbor. as i sat, i looked up for a moment to see what progress kaylie, krista and alex made. i saw kaylie and krista on all fours climbin up and watched another random dude slip onto his ass on his descent. thanks for telling me to take a seat goats.</p>

  <p>up at one of the valley walls on the columbia river gorge is the vista house, which is home to the "$100,000 outhouse". at every tourist trap and scenic viewpoint there seemed to be a decked out with what seemed to be iceland's equivalent. little did i know, this would be the last one on the journey. Maybe it was finally a sign we were moving beyond even what iceland knew as the extent of the typical flyover outdoor excursion people take on the way to europe. whatever, i'll gladly take the lack of marble thrones if it means weaving through less selfies. </p>

<p>siggi let us in on how all the meandering goats are handled in iceland. with no natural predators on the island, at the start of spring, people just open their field gates and let the goats slowly depart. as summer comes to an end, neighbors get together and people are assigned quadrants stretching out into the mountains and valleys. they go out and herd goats all back to a communal sheepcote where they get sorted by each farmers marker.</p>

    <p>it quickly became a herd of boats chasing down what little glimpses of marine mammals there were in the harbor. felt a bit weird. i can only imagine what a frenzy this place is in june during the peak season.</p>

      <p>we went to a concert in akureyri our second to last night. after dancin around a drinking some beers, alex was determined to keep the night going. however little did we know the city shutdown promptly at 11 with covid. we kept on alex's heels as he frantically ran up to each bar lookin for a night cap only to be shooed away by every bartender he encountered. defeated, we all meandered back to our apartment to drink what little booze we had left after a week on the road playing drinking games everynight.
        as we poured a drink, alex caught a glimpse of our neighbors having a drink on the shared patio. in depseration for any sort of intoxicated socializing, he inserted himself into the conversation. they kindly let a bunch of americans crash their evening and filled our cups with icelandic rum. from what i can remember, the guy was a builder for ice wear, which owned the apartments we were staying in and let us in on a bunch drama/gossip and small world of being a contractor in iceland. he knew all the guys behind our stays at hotels with unfinished structures. cheers to you random stranger. you made alex's night haha.</p>

    <p>the next morning, head throbbing at 9:15 am, we found out the only covid testing site in town closed for the day at 10:00 am, which we needed to exit the country the next day. we also had to check out by 11:00 am. we all some how managed to get our asses over there. although krista damn near left alex on the toilet. nothing like staring at a church hungover after getting your brain tickled via your nose....</p>
